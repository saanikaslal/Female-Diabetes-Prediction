<h1>Logistic Regression Project: Predicting Diabetes Outcome</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project uses logistic regression to predict diabetes outcomes based on patient data, focusing on factors like the number of pregnancies, blood glucose levels, and other health metrics. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that helps identify individuals at risk of diabetes.

<h2>Dataset</h2>h2>

The dataset contains medical information for 768 patients, including features that are known to be associated with diabetes risk. Each patient is labeled with an outcome (0 or 1), where:

0 indicates a negative diabetes diagnosis
1 indicates a positive diabetes diagnosis
<h2>Features</h2>

The dataset includes the following columns:

Pregnancies: Number of times the patient has been pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Family history of diabetes (pedigree function score)
Age: Age of the patient (years)
Outcome: Target variable (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic)
